# scripts from my **computer simulation** classes

Ones that worth short explanation (or screenshot):  
  * `fractal.py` - script that can build fractal tree using defined by used pattern and custom parameters;  
    ![Window for parameters and patterns](/../screenshots/fractal0.png "Simple window for parameters and pattern")
    ![Tree1](/../screenshots/fractal1.png "Generated tree 1")
    ![tree2](/../screenshots/fractal2.png "Generated tree 2")
  * `game_of_life.py` - standard and silly implementation of *Game Of Life* from scratch; But with some custom pattern `which neighbour cells live / which neighbour cells die`  
    ![Game of Life](/../screenshots/game_of_life.gif "Game of life in action")
  * `string_simulation.py` - graph that show guitar string movement (top plot) and it kinetic and potential energies (bottom plot);  
    ![String movement 1](/../screenshots/string_movement1.png)
    ![String movement 2](/../screenshots/string_movement2.png)
  * `heatmap.py`  
    ![Heatmap](/../screenshots/heatmap.png)
